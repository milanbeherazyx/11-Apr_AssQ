    "> An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method of combining multiple models to improve the overall performance of a machine learning algorithm. Ensemble techniques can be used for both classification and regression problems, and they typically involve training several models independently on the same data and then combining their predictions. There are several types of ensemble techniques, including bagging, boosting, and stacking, each of which uses a different approach to combine the models. The goal of ensemble techniques is to improve the accuracy, robustness, and stability of the machine learning models by reducing the impact of individual model errors and biases."

    "> Boosting is a technique in machine learning that combines weak learners or base models to form a strong learner. It is an iterative process that works by first training a weak model on the original data, then reweighting the training set to place more emphasis on the examples that were misclassified in the previous iteration. The next weak model is then trained on the reweighted data, and this process is repeated until a predetermined stopping criterion is met. The final model is a combination of all the weak models, weighted according to their accuracy and performance on the training data. Boosting is often used to improve the performance of decision trees, and it has been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems."

The confidence interval is then estimated as the range of values that contains a specified percentage (e.g., 95%) of the bootstrap sample distribution, centered around the point estimate. This range is often referred to as the \"bootstrap percentile interval\". Alternatively, the confidence interval can be estimated as the mean plus or minus a multiple of the standard error, where the multiple is determined by the desired level of confidence and the distribution of the statistic. This method is known as the \"bootstrap-t interval\". The confidence interval can also be calculated using other methods, such as the \"bias-corrected and accelerated\" (BCa) method, which adjusts for bias and skewness in the bootstrap sample distribution."
